# Introduction

A data analysis package that helps users determine the mean, standard deviation and probability distribution of different datasets and outcomes. 

## Motivation 
The goal is to create a package that would help academics and data professionals alike in quickly determining the Probability Distributions of their dataset and visualising it.  


## File Descriptions 
The ``setup.py`` and ``test.py`` scripts are the set-up configuration and the unittest files for the distribution package respectively. distributions package contains ``Binomialdistribution_challenge.py`` for Binomial distribution, ``Gaussiandistribution.py`` for Gaussian distribution and ``Generaldistribution.py`` for reading the data fromm file. 



## Installations
The package was written in Python. Any Python version above 3.0 should work. If you would like to install the package in your local machine, it is advisable to install it in a new environment with the latest python installation.
