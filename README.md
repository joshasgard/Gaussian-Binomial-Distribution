# Introduction

A data analysis package that helps users determine the mean, standard deviation and probability distribution of different datasets and outcomes. 

## Motivation 
The goal is to create a package that would help academics and data professionals alike in quickly determining the Probability Distributions of their dataset and visualising it.  


## File Descriptions 
The ``setup.py`` and ``test.py`` scripts are the set-up configuration and the unittest files for the distribution package respectively. distributions package contains ``Binomialdistribution_challenge.py`` for Binomial distribution, ``Gaussiandistribution.py`` for Gaussian distribution and ``Generaldistribution.py`` for reading the data fromm file.
